When creating a subselection of a matrix the sub selection can have up to as many dimensions as the matrix has.

The subselection specifies a selection per axis where each selection is a 1D selection (point, closed or open interval)

Example

	M = matrix(dict(row=4, col=4, cell=coordinate_reference('row', 'col')))
	M.row[3]	M.row[0:2]		M.row[0, 1]
	M.cell[(0, 2)]
