API families

	construction (to be determined)

		*	from_table
		*	from_raster_table
		*	from_path
		*	from_text
		*	from_tree
		*	from_node
		*	from_sequence
		*	from_item


	data processing

		High level processors
			These will optionally include a post processing step and are used with generators

			*	process_table
			*	process_text
			*	process_tree
			*	process_sequence

		Generator based processors

			*	process_table_iteratively
			*	process_text_iteratively
			*	process_tree_iteratively
			*	process_sequence_iteratively

		Item specific processor
			These will handle one item at a time

			*	process_node
			*	process_item


	Notes:

		in essence we can divide these 3 families into two main kingdoms:
			* sequential
			* item



	Tangential:
		If we want to use taxonomy ranking we would use:

			domain
			kingdom
			family
			species

			We have removed life, phylum and genus since it is too biology related. We also removed class and order to avoid ambiguity with computer science terms. 4 ranks should be enough.
