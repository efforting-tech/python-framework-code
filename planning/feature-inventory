Feature: CC - Condition Checking

Feature: DC - Data Conversion

	This feature is about automatically converting data which can be quite useful in constructor chains to make for versatile typing.
	This feature is not properly defined yet.

	Currently we have some functions defined in a base class (lib/abstract_base_classes/__init__.py)

		_auto_convert(self, value)
			Returns value if value is of instance self, otherwise calls _convert

		_convert(self, value)
			Unconditionally converts value to instance of self

	I do not think I want it like this though, I think I want to keep the type clean and have a separate interface for this.
	This could potentially be tied to the type metadata. Then one could add more rules to further customize the behavior.



Feature: ABC - Abstract Base Classes

Feature: API - Application Programming Interface

Feature: CDD - Conditional Data Processing

Feature: DU - Development Utils

Feature: MSS - Math Sub System
	This feature is one of many sketches where the newer sketches are likely to supercede this one.
	In the new sketch vectors and matrices will both just be rank specific tensors.

Feature: RF - Rudimentary Features
