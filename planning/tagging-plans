Introduction

	The idea with the tagging system is to make sure that only specific comments counts as non pending items.
	This does not mean that there should be no comment once everything is complete but it does mean that comments need to be of a particular kind.
	For instance some comments may reference the documentation because there might be some weird detail that needs further explanation, in such cases
		a short in code explanation should be given together with a link to the documentation covering it to at least the same degree.


Note
	Tags that apply to this document must use double number sign (##) since this document is talking about the single number sign tags

(losely) Defined tags
